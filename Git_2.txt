Dev A creates a new repo and uploads it on github.
Now Dev B downloads it and wants to contribute to the project then Dev A 
needs to add Dev B as a "Contributor".

While doing git push we need to mention the name of the remote repo.
Because there can be multiple remote repo attached to a local project.

git remote add origin "Link"
I am changing this line online thorugh github
